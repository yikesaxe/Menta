**Menta**
Menta is a revolutionary app designed to track and enhance your progress in mental activities, similar to how Strava tracks physical exercises. Whether you're coding, reading, studying, or attending intellectual events/pursuits, Menta helps you stay motivated and connected with like-minded individuals.

**Motivation and Goals**
At its core, Menta is about motivation and self-improvement. By connecting with others, tracking your progress, and participating in challenges, you can become the best version of yourself. Menta aims to create a vibrant community where intellectual pursuits are celebrated and shared. 

**Problem Statement**
Many individuals seeking to engage in or enhance their intellectual pursuits—such as coding, reading, or studying—often encounter significant barriers that discourage continuous engagement. These barriers typically include a lack of motivation, absence of a supportive community, and inadequate tools for tracking and visualizing personal progress. Without these key elements, maintaining regular involvement in intellectual activities becomes challenging, leading to a decrease in learning effectiveness and reduced personal growth. This gap in support and resources makes it difficult for individuals to start new intellectual hobbies or persist in developing their skills in existing ones.
